Ernie Ball Music Man (USA) began producing John Petrucci signature guitars in 2001 and have made numerous models bearing his name since. The Majesty is the result of John's unwavering demand for high-performance and playability. One of the most ergonomic and perfectly balanced instruments available, the Majesty features neck-through-body design, unparalleled upper and lower fret access, economical in-line control knob placement, and new digital pickup switching capabilities, which effectively eliminate the delay between pickup selection. The Majesty is the exemplification of everything we know a John Petrucci signature model to be - innovative technology, versatile performance, and a sleek modern feel.",

    "description": "Paul Gilbert primarily uses his Ibanez PGM signature series guitars, identified by the unique painted on \"F-holes\". Although earlier PGM models featured the Ibanez Lo-Pro/Edge double locking tremolo system, many of his guitars (such as his main PGM300) were modified to accommodate a fixed bridge after he stopped using whammy bars in the early 90s, hence the Ibanez PGM301 guitar. Along with his signature guitars, Gilbert often uses his sticker-covered \"Dino\" Ibanez RG750, in addition to a wide variety of Ibanez solid-body and semi-hollow electric guitars. Recently, Gilbert has been using Ibanez \"Fireman\" (a reversed-body Ibanez Iceman with single-coil pickups and an extra cutaway) guitars, which he designed himself.",
